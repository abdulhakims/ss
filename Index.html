                <p>Sometimes, the biggest obstacle between you and your goals is simply taking the first step. Doubt, fear, and excuses creep in—but here's the truth: you're more capable than you think. Whether you're chasing a personal record, starting something new, or pushing past your limits, don’t wait for the perfect moment. There is no perfect moment. Just do it anyway. Do it when you're tired. Do it when you’re uncertain. Do it when no one’s watching. Because every time you show up, you get stronger. You grow. You become the version of yourself you've always wanted to be. So lace up, step out, and chase it—whatever it is. Just. Do. It.</p>
